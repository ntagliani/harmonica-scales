# Harmonica scales

Long time ago I used to navigate to overblow.com to check for the scales on the harmonica.
Now my knowledge of the instrument is not improved but I want to learn a little bit of javascript.

The main idea of this project is to have a little page hosted on github pages where I could quickly check harmonica scales and eventually my intonation.
For this reason I want to include from the beginning on of this project a simple (hopefully) pitch detector that will show how in tune is every note played on the armonica.
I home it would be helpful to someone who like me is still trying to improve his bending technique.
